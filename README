 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Notez is a note-taking app
  for the UNIX-based terminal.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Available commands should be:

  notez [<list>]
  notez a[dd] [<title> [<message>]]
  notez d[el] [<title>|<num>]
  notez s[earch] [<str>]
  notez rs[earch] [<regex>]

Notez is also an exercise in
  * C programming
  * the use of git
  * teamwork

Current plan is to implement support for:
  * SQLite3 back-end for database storage
  * PCRE support for regex-based searches
  * hierarchical indexing
