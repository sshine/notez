 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Notez is a note-taking app
  for the UNIX-based terminal.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Available commands should be:

  notez [list]
  notez add [<title> [<message>]]
  notez del <title>/<num>
  notez search <str>

Notez is also an exercise in
  * C programming
  * the use of git
  * teamwork

Current plan is to implement support for:
  * SQLite3 back-end for database storage
  * PCRE support for regex-based searches
  * hierarchical indexing
